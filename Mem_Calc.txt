Calculating Memory Requirements for R Objects
Because R stores all of its objects physical memory, it is important to be cognizant of how much
memory is being used up by all of the data objects residing in your workspace. One situation where
it’s particularly important to understand memory requirements is when you are reading in a new
dataset into R. Fortunately, it’s easy to make a back of the envelope calculation of how much memory
will be required by a new dataset.
For example, suppose I have a data frame with 1,500,000 rows and 120 columns, all of which are
numeric data. Roughly, how much memory is required to store this data frame? Well, on most
modern computers double precision floating point numbers are stored using 64 bits of memory, or
8 bytes. Given that information, you can do the following calculation

1,500,000 × 120 × 8 bytes/numeric = 1,440,000,000 bytes
= 1,440,000,000 / 220 bytes/MB
= 1,373.29 MB
= 1.34 GB
So the dataset would require about 1.34 GB of RAM.
